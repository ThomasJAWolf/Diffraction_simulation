# Diffraction_simulation
Simple code to simulate electron diffraction signals from molecular geometry files. The code
is geared towards users of the MeV ultrafast electron diffraction facility at SLAC National
Accelerator Laboratory (https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/instruments/mev-ued)
Details can be found in the comments of Diffraction.py. Apart from the file Diffraction.py, 
the repository contains several output files of the ELSEPA program 
(https://github.com/eScatter/elsepa) for different elements and a *.xyz geometry file of
1,3-cyclohexadiene.
